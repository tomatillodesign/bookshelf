# Bookshelf ðŸ“˜

Interactive shelves for tracking books you've read and what you're going to read next.


## Objective

This project was created by Chris Liu-Beers of [Tomatillo Design](http://www.tomatillodesign.com) as a fun way to practice building in React. The goal is to create an interesting way for users to keep track of their reading.


## Features

- Personalized book shelves for each visitor
- Basic suite of account tools (registration, lost password, etc.)
- Clean, clear navigation using React Router
- Filter and sort shelves view by different criteria


## Technical Credits

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [React Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router)
- [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [React Flip Toolkit](https://github.com/aholachek/react-flip-toolkit)
- [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages)


## To Do's

- Clean up the registration language and make the process as simple as possible
- Calculate advanced stats, eg # of books read this year, # of pages, average book rating, etc.
- Setup 3-4 different themes (fonts + colors), available on the Settings page
- Fix flashing book image (too many hits to Google's servers for the featured image)
- Mobile-friendly
- Clean up code, remove console logs, etc.
- Speed up navigation (possibly remove React Router - try it on a new branch)


## Next Level

- Add your own book (not using Google Books search)
- Upload your own cover image for any book
